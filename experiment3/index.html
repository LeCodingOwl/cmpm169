			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I asked ChatGPt to give me ideas of generative design, which it offered me 12 ideas. I was curious about automated doodles, so I 
					further asked to give me examples of it, which I found the perlin doodle the most interesting. I wanted to create a cat that had a 
					rainbow trail behind it, so I fiddled around with making shapes merged and moving together. When putting those two codes together, 
					I got this weird graphical design which I went along with. I wanted to add bouncing text that had the word “ERROR” on it. I first 
					tested it with it bouncing on the walls of the canvas, then tried adding gravity to the text. The design however didn’t seem appealing 
					to me, so I reverted back to the text bouncing off walls. An idea was suggested by a friend of mine to make the background look like a png, 
					so I messed around in p5.js and had code that would create a checker design, and make it light gray and white, similar to the checker pattern 
					on a png image.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I first started off with the perlin doodle code created by ChatGPT, then added code of merging shapes code I was messing around with. From there, I 
					added code of the bouncing text. I went through different implementations for how I wanted the text to interact with the canvas, the first one with 
					gravity but I didn’t like how it piled up on the bottom. I changed it where the text would bounce around the walls of the canvas, no gravity manipulating 
					the text. I originally was going to make the background stars but a friend suggested I make it look like a png, so I messed around with p5.js to create code 
					that would print out boxes into a checker pattern. Putting it all together created a very creative and interesting design. </p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>When first starting on the assignment, I asked ChatGPT to give me ideas of generative designs made in P5.js, which offered 12 ideas. The one that caught my 
					attention was automated doodles, which I further asked to provide examples of that design. The example I picked from was perlin noise doodle. The example reminded 
					me of a trail and I thought of making each printed circle a different color, creating a trail of rainbows. Then I thought of the internet meme of a cat flying in 
					space, “Nyan Cat” and thought it would be cool to recreate itt. While trying to implement the cat, it created an interesting design, in which the cat would also be 
					printed repeatedly on the canvas and it reminded me of a graphical error where a window page would print out multiple times, layering on top of each other. I decided 
					to go with that idea, making my Nyan Cat a graphical error. After implementing the graphical error cat, I thought it was still plain, so I added a bouncing text that 
					spelt “ERROR” That would bounce around and print the text over the canvas. Everything looked good so far, but I felt that it was missing something. A friend of mine 
					suggested that I make the background look like a png, so I wrote code that would print a checker box to create that png look to it. After putting it all together, the 
					design looks really amazing.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I worked on it solo, with additional help from ChatGPT and a friend for ideas. This experiment felt a bit easier to do since I am now more familiar 
					with what is required for these experiments. I had a lot of fun with this experiment, especially coming up with ideas along the way when I accidentally created something 
					that seemed cool to implement. My highest moment would have to be adding the png background. I thought it gave a nice touch to the overall design. My lowest moment on this 
					experiment was not being able to implement my original idea of the error message. Overall, I really like what I created.</p>
