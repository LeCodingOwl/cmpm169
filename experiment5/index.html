			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I was really fascinated by the terrain project made by Taigo and it gave me the idea of 
					using audio to control the looks of the grid. I created a simple project that would allow 
					me to experiment with sound. In the simple audio project, I created boxes that would 
					stretch based on the sound.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After tweaking and fiddling around with the codes on both projects, I merge the two and continue
					making adjustments to the code. The waves reminded me of water and ocean so I thought of trying 
					to make a retro style background, but I could not get the image of the retro sun to work with my idea, 
					scraping the idea and kept the project simple with a blue grid instead. I made more adjustments to the 
					code so that it would be easier to visualize the effects of the audio.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I first started off with tinkering the Terrain project by Taigo and learned how their project worked. 
					Afterwards I created a simple project that allowed me to experiment with sound and how I could use it to 
					manipulate the grid. Then I combined the two projects together to create a grid that was affected by audio. 
					After tweaking and changing some of the variables, I managed to create what you see in the last image in the 
					Imitate section.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this project, I worked alone on it. I think the overall work was okay but could have been better. 
					There were things I wanted to include for this project, but couldn't implement it due to having issues 
					getting it to work and time constraints. I am proud of the final result though. Itâ€™s really cool to look 
					at and see the music react with the grid.</p>
