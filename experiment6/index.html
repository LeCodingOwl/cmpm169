			<h1>Experiment 6: Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I asked chatGPT to provide me ideas of text based art for p5.js, and it provided several examples, 
					such as Word Cloud, Typographic Animation, ASCII Art Generator, Morse Code Visualizer, and Interactive Poetry. 
					I decided to try making a morse code visualizer. ChatGPT provided a simple example for me to get me started. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>While the simple example was neat with the base sample, I wanted to add audio for each dot and dash that would play, 
					similar to an actual morse code device. I ran into several problems, such as the audio not playing the entire line of 
					morse code, the audio endlessly playing, and the audio playing too quickly, making it difficult to hear the different sounds. 
					Luckily, I had a friend who pointed out some of the errors. After fixing those errors, I got the program running, with the proper 
					audio sounds.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Most of the innovation was swapping many of the code that chatGPT provided in the example code to code that allowed audio to play 
					for each dot and dash. Furthermore, the code that swapped was necessary to prevent running into any bugs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this experiment mostly by myself, plus a friend who helped fix some of the errors that I was having, mainly the audio issue. 
					The good part of working this experiment was getting the audio to work properly. The bad part of this experiment was spending hours 
					debugging the program, and trying to understand why the audio isn't working. Iâ€™m very thankful for my friend to help me, otherwise, I may 
					have spent longer debugging.</p>
