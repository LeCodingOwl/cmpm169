			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>After tinkering around with the code from another art source, I learned to use the colorful boxes and turned into an animated colorful rain fall. 
					I first changed some of the variables and learned to make a blur effect on the boxes and how to adjust the amount of color that should appear on 
					the canvas. During the process of integrating code to create animated fireflies, credited to ChatGPT, I ran into an error that presented a new idea 
					of making the rain drops animated instead of static.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>The only form of integration that was made on this experiment was adding the example code that ChatGPT generated to create animated fireflies that would 
					fly around on the canvas. During the process of integrating the example code, I stumbled upon an error which accidentally created animated raindrops. From 
					there, I removed the fireflies code and changed a few lines of code to create the animated falling raindrops.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>While some of the code remains the same, I made several changes to the original code, tweaking a few lines of code to generate the desired design that I was 
					going for. From what I originally wanted, which was static raindrops to floating lanterns with fireflies, I was able to somewhat accomplish a more interesting 
					and mesmerizing design of colorful raindrops falling from the deep dark blue sky.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this project, I was the sole contributor and worked on it all by myself. I'm very proud of the final result, and I didn't expect the stunning outcome of what 
					I created. Throughout this project, I learned many things through experimentation. I am amazed by creating something I wouldn't have expected. Unfortunately, I 
					could not submit my project on time, but I consider this mistake an opportunity to have more time to discover ideas and experiment that I wouldn't be able to try 
					if I had rushed to submit it on the day the project was due.</p>
