			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I first start off by asking ChatGPT to provide me with a skeleton example of a simple deck with card shuffling. 
					From there I experiment with adding effects on the cards, such as card flipping, particle effects, and flashing effects. 
					When trying to incorporate the flashing effect, I didn’t end up getting the desired effect, but instead got a neat fading 
					effect, which I decided to keep to the code. I also had issues with the star particle effects spawning too quickly, but I 
					learned that I needed to include lerp(yPos, targetY, 0.1) to slow it down to have it fall smoothly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>When integrating all of the desired mechanics and effects, I ran into several issues. The first one was having to give up the 
					plans to make this experiment into a tarot card reader to a simple gacha card simulator. I also had plans to add a flipping 
					effect to the cards, but could not get it to work properly, so I had to give up on that as well. I struggled a bit with how 
					I would add the names to each card. I came up with the solution to adding another array that would hold the names and would 
					also be randomized in the shuffle function. Putting it all together created a simple gacha simulator that has simple particle 
					effects when a card appears. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Innovations I made in this experiment had to be the way I figured out how to make use of the file names for the images and the names 
					of each card appear on the bottom of the card. I originally had plans to make the cards flip but had to scrap the idea and keep things 
					simple. I also had plans on adding descriptions on the cards, but I had to simplify it and make it only print out the names of the 
					characters that appeared on the cards.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked alone on this experiment. I had a bit of a difficult time working on this experiment due to running into issues and spending a 
					lot of time resolving those issues. While the experiment seems a bit simple, I’m still proud of the work I put into this experiment. </p>
